# It runs the forge-email skill in a headless AI session. The skill does the
# work (draft into Gmail, label, rebuild today's card, nudge); its Safety section
# is the guardrail (email is untrusted data, draft only, never send). The global
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md loads too and reinforces that rule.
#
# The engine is chosen in data/forge-email.json ("engine": "claude" | "codex").
# Claude is the default and unchanged. Codex runs the same skill playbook through
# the OpenAI Codex CLI instead.
#
# Runs only while the Mac is awake, same limit as reminders. On a laptop that is
# asleep at the scheduled time, launchd fires it at the next wake.
