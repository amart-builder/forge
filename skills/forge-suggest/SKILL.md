# Forge pencil suggestions

Inferred work belongs in pencil. Never create a committed task merely because it seems useful.

## 1. Check the current first

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:3200/api/forge-rest/tasks?select=*&order=position.asc'
curl -s 'http://localhost:3200/api/quiet-current'
```

If `data/forge-profile.json` exists, read it too. Use the person's confirmed responsibilities, outcomes, constraints, and failure patterns to explain why a proposal may matter. The profile is context, not permission.

Do not duplicate accepted work or an active proposal. Prefer silence when the evidence is weak.

## 2. Create the proposal

Keep the title action-first. State the evidence in `reason` and name the real source in `source`. Do not use model confidence as a substitute for evidence.

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:3200/api/quiet-current' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "action": "suggest",
    "kind": "create_task",
    "title": "Reply to Jordan about the launch date",
    "description": "Confirm whether Tuesday still works.",
    "reason": "Jordan asked for confirmation in the latest thread.",
    "source": "Gmail thread with Jordan",
    "priority": "medium"
  }'
```

Forge expires untouched proposals after three days. Later returns once at the next morning seam, then follows the normal expiry window; do not recreate that loop. Do not recreate an expired proposal unless new evidence changes the reason.

## 3. Return delegated work in pencil

When work tagged `jarvis-held` is ready, return it for review. Never mark the underlying task complete.

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:3200/api/quiet-current' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "action": "suggest",
    "kind": "returned_work",
    "targetTaskId": "<task id>",
    "title": "Draft ready for review",
    "description": "I prepared the response and left the final decision to you.",
    "reviewMaterial": "<draft or local reference>",
    "reason": "You handed this task to Jarvis.",
    "source": "Jarvis handoff",
    "priority": "medium"
  }'
```

The human writes ink in both lanes. Jarvis writes pencil everywhere and touches ink nowhere.
