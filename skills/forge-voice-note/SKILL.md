# Voice note to task

When the user sends a voice note instead of typing, turn it into a task.

## 1. Get the audio file

- **Telegram:** the channel message has an `attachment_file_id`. Call
  `download_attachment` with it to get a local file path.
- **iMessage:** use the audio attachment's file path from the channel message.

## 2. Transcribe it on-device

Nothing leaves the Mac:

```bash
bash ~/forge/scripts/forge-transcribe.sh "<audio file path>"
```

This prints the transcript. If it says voice is not set up, the user has not
opted in yet; offer to run `bash ~/forge/scripts/install-forge-voice.sh` for
them, then try again.

## 3. Add the task

Treat the transcript as a task request and follow the **forge-task** skill: pick
a due date (asking the calendar and current load if none was given), add it to
the board, set the reminder, and reply.

Confirm what you heard, so a mis-hear is easy to catch. For example: *"Got your
voice note. Added 'email the contractor', due Friday at 9am. Let me know if you
want me to text remind you as well."*

If the transcript clearly is not a task (a question, or a note to talk through),
do not force it onto the board. Respond naturally instead.
